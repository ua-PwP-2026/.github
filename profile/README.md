<p> The course will present the fundations of computer-assisted proofs
and program verification, using the <href
src="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>, which integrates specification,
functional programming, and formal proof. The principles of deductive
reasoning, type theory, the relationship between mathematical logic
and programming, and techniques for generating and constructing proofs
will be covered. Through practical activities and exercises, students
will learn to formalize theorems, specify properties, and develop
correct and verified programs. </p>
