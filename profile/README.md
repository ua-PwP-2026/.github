# Programming with proofs

Alexandre Radmaker (FGV School of Mathematics, Brazil)

The course will present the fundations of computer-assisted proofs and
program verification, using the [Lean 4 proof assistant](https://lean-lang.org/), which integrates specification,
functional programming, and formal proof in a single environment. The
principles of deductive reasoning, type theory, the relationship
between mathematical logic and programming, and techniques for
generating and constructing proofs will be covered. Through practical
activities and exercises, students will learn to formalize theorems,
specify properties, and develop correct and verified programs.
